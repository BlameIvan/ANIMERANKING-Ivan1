        <div>Commander Erwin Death [Attack on Titan]</div> 
        
        <div class="DeathText">
          Commander Erwin Smith dies during the battle to reclaim Shiganshina. Erwin leads a suicidal charge, inspiring his soldiers to follow him in a last-ditch effort to give Levi a chance to defeat the Beast Titan. Severely wounded by a barrage of stones thrown by the Beast Titan, Erwin succumbs to his injuries. His death is a significant turning point, symbolizing the heavy sacrifices made in the fight for humanityâ€™s survival. His death cemented him as a martyr for the fight against the titans.</div>

      <div id="item2">Kaori's Death [Your Lie in April]
        <div class="DeathText">
          Kaori Miyazono, a vibrant violinist, dies from a serious illness after helping Kousei Arima rediscover his love for music. Despite her condition, she hides the severity and inspires him to overcome his trauma. After her surgery fails, Kousei receives a letter where she confesses her love and thanks him for bringing joy to her final days. This is truly one of the saddest deaths that I've experienced in an anime. I cannot lie, I shed a tear or two.</div>

      <div id="item3">Jiraiya's Death [Naruto]
        <div class="DeathText">Jiraiya, a legendary Jonin and one of Naruto's mentors, dies during a battle against his former student, Pain. Despite fighting bravely and using all of his skills, Jiraiya is overwhelmed and mortally wounded. Jiraiya's death is a pivotal moment, filled with emotion, sacrifice, and honor, deeply affecting Naruto and the story. This is was an extremely sad, but also avoidable death. Jiraiya confidently strolled into Pain's domain when he should've had back up. Nonetheless, anime fans mourn this memorable character.</div>
