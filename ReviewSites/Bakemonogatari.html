      <h3>Quick Summary</h3>
      <p class="ReviewText"> Those of you who have watched Bakemonogatari , are definitely up in arms about the rating. First of all, this is my website and I don't have to justify my ratings, they are entirely objective and based on facts and logic. Second of all, this show is amazing, it is just incredibly confusing and really only gets good when you watch the other 50 spinoff shows. I am rating THIS specfic season, for what it is, it is great. There is tons of crazy action with goofy villains, but also an unorthodox relationship between the main character and one of these "monsters" that he meets. But, without having watched every other spinoff show that comes after it, it is incredibly confusing. I also really disliked the random flashes of Japanese text that would pop up because I could not understand it and subtitles weren't provided for them, which felt like I was missing a lot of the suble jokes and story they were trying to build. The shows jokes are really hard to decipher for a non-Japanese speaker as they are usually puns or idioms from the Japanese language, which do not translate well in subtitles. Other than those factors, I've got to say this was a pretty fun ride to watch.
