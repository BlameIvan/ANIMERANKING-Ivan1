      <h3>Quick Summary</h3>
      <p class="ReviewText">This is the anime that set the bar. I was told not to watch this as one of my first anime by my friends as it would set the standard to high. They were completely right, I can definitely say this anime is going to be remembered for a long time. Like Game of Thrones, the ending is controversial, many dislike it but I thought it was a perfect way to end such a complicated show. The characters are beyond amazing, with great motivations, and even more loveable personalities. This show is not afraid to kill characters, and I love it for that. We see the deaths of many beloved characters, all the while thinking "No way they actually just did that." The only reason that you can have for not watching this anime is that you are dead, GO WATCH IT NOW!
