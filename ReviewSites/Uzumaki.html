      <h3>Quick Summary</h3>
      <p class="ReviewText">This anime is the ultimate case of gradual deteriation. Episode 1 was close to perfect. The pacing of the episode is a bit quick which is fair considering they have to adapt 3 volumes worth of material, but the animation, atmosphere, and soundtrack more than make up for it. Then we get to the second episode, the pacing ramps up over 9000% and the animation becomes horrible. Seeing the animation in the second episode made me have a visceral reaction, I genuinely cannot describe the dissapointment I felt. Back to the pacing, no joke there were atleast 5 plotlines going at the same time, which could have been resolved by just cutting the fluff-which there is a lot of in the manga-and getting straight to the meat and potatoes. I know this is supposed to be a "Quick Summary" but this shows horrible execution made me want to claw my eyes out. I was utterly dissapointed, they had teased this anime for SEVEN FREAKING YEARS WITH MULTIPLE DELAYS and they release a trailer showing ONLY the first episode-coincedentally the only one with half decent animation-and then release this half baked piece of work. I think Junji Itou's work might be cursed. Every attempt to adapt his great manga ends up in utter failure. For Example the Junji Itou collection which was also a complete dissapointment. It's suffice to say I will continue to just enjoy Uzumaki's manga version, and I advise you to do the same.
