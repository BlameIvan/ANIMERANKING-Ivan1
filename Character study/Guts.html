      <p class="ReviewText"> Guts is the titular character of Berserk, and with so many cool and unique character, how is our MC able to standout? Well for one he has a rocket launcher AS A PROSTHETIC FOR HIS MISSING ARM THAT HE LOST WHILE FIGHTING DEMONS. Sorry that elicited a strong reaction from me, but it's just so easy to shower Guts with praise. Guts', at first, is a machine motivated by hatred and trying to escape fate. The "God Hand" has predetermined the course of Guts' life, but that does not stop our main character from attempting to change fate itself. When he is saved during the eclipe Guts' becomes a machine full of hatred, something the characters that surround him seem to notice, and they take advantage of this. Guts' early life was not easy, as he was abused as a child and was deemed as a "cursed childs" because he was born while his mother died from asphyxiation from being hanged. He meets his best-friend and his girlfriend, the former of which completely betrays him in a desperate attempt for power and vitality. With this power he then abuses Guts' girlfriend in front of his eyes. She becomes non-verbal and does not want to be touched by Guts' nor any other men. This destroys Guts as he realizes the man he once shared his dreams and aspirations with threw him under the bus for power. This fuels Guts' for the majority of the story. Taking down some innocents, and more bad guys on the way to exact his revenge. But his character is not irredeemable as the story progress he starts anew and tries to change for the better while still continuing his journey.
