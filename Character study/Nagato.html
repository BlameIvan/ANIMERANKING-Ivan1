      <p class="ReviewText"> Nagato's alias, Pain, encapsulates the character so well. Nagato goes throughout his entire life only knowing suffering, in the Hidden Rain Village he faces the pain of losing his family. When he tries to fight with peace in the early days of the Akatsuki, he becomes disillusioned with their methods after his childhood friend dies. He decides that the only way to escape the cycle of war and despair is through pain, he must instill fear and pain on others so they become deterred from committing acts. This is why his character is so inherently flawed, he doesn't understand that this same pain that causes him to commit horrible acts will enable others to commit more heinous acts. Pains violence contributes to the entire cycle of violence and revenge that we see throughout the series. Being burdened with the powerful Rinnnegan, he distances himself from humanity entirely and considers himself a god. This causes him to disregard the feelings of others and even of the people he once considered friends. All in all, Nagato is a top tier villain from a top tier show.
